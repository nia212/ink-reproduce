# INK Reproduction – Experiment Outputs

This artifact contains reproduced experiment results for the INK system:
https://github.com/utopia-group/ink

## What is shown
- Aggregated benchmark results 
- Generated figures comparing synthesis time and success rate
- Full raw experiment outputs for verification

## Key results
- INK successfully synthesized merge operators for all benchmarks used
- Synthesis time is comparable to the values reported in the paper
- No runtime failures were observed during reproduction

## How outputs were generated
1. nix develop
2. cd evaluation
3. bash evaluation.sh run_ink
4. python eval.py

## Directory structure
- summary/: processed tables for quick inspection
- figures/: plots generated by eval.py
- raw/: unmodified evaluation/output from the experiments
